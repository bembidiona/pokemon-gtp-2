# pokemon-gtp-2
AI-generated pokemons with GTP-2.\
Model trained with the original 151 Pokemon's [sprites](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bembidiona/pokemon-gtp-2/master/_readme-files/pokedex.png) and [names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_generation_I_Pok%C3%A9mon).

## Pokemon Kadath Region
After the training, for this generated batch [Lovecraftian names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos_deities) are used as seed.

Public [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pokemon.kadath.region/) with all the generated pokemons.

#### Notes:
- For the big guys there are two models: One tries two draw them top to bottom, and the other from bottom to top. 
So most of the big sprites are stitched at the middle.
- All results are quite cherry picked, and for a few cards I swapped their generated sprites (Like for the "The God Worm" card I chose a generated sprite that, to me at least, looked the most like a worm)

## ¿Sueñan los Ashdroides con Mareep?
Here the real pokemon name is used as pront, but with hight temperature.\
Then a couple of cherry-picked results are chosen as a kickstart for a illustrated HD version.
